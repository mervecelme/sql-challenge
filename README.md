## Data Modeling

- Inspected the CSV files and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables.
- Used QuickDBD tool to create the ERD

## Data Engineering

- Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
  - Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  - Verified that primary key columns are unique; if not, created composite keys.
  - Created the tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
- Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
  - Imported data in the same order as the tables were created.
  - Accounted for headers when doing the imports.
